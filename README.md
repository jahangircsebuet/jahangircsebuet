###################################################### Evolution of ML/DL #############################################


When it comes to Deep Learning, I think nobody symbolizes the field better than Geoffrey Hinton, the father of Deep Learning. He even coined the term! Here are his biggest contributions to the field:

- 1986 - He invents the Boltzmann machines
- 1985 - He proposes a new learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines
- 1986 - He is credited as one of the inventors of the Back-propagation algorithm
- 1991 - He invents the Mixture of Experts
- 2006 - He proposes an algorithm to train Deep Belief Nets. This is the article that led to the term "Deep Learning"
- 2006 - He shows how to build Autoencoders with Neural Networks
- 2008 - He invents t-SNE, a new technique for dimension reduction
- 2009 - He presents an algorithm to train Deep Boltzmann machines
- 2009 - Trains Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks with the CIFAR-10 dataset
- 2010 - Shows the improved performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machines with ReLU
- 2011 - Shows how to build a generative text model with Recurrent Neural Networks
- 2012 - Invents RMSprop in a course lecture (!!!)
- 2012 - Proposes the Feature Dropout technique to improve networks
- 2012 - Suggests mini-batch gradient descent in a course lecture
- 2012 - Deep Learning for speech recognition
- 2014 - Revolutions computer vision capabilities with AlexNet (the most cited paper of his whole career)
- 2014 - He proposes the Dropout technique to reduce overfitting
- 2014 - the CIFAR 10 dataset is made available
- 2015 - He invents the Distillation Network to reduce the size of models
- 2016 - He invents the Layer Normation technique (used in every Transformer architecture
- 2017- He proposes CapsNets, or Capsule networks aiming to overcome some limitations of CNNs, particularly in the area of understanding hierarchical relationships between objects and their parts within an image
- 2022 - He presents a new alternative to the Back-propagation algorithm: the Forward-forward algorithm

Now, the guy has 327 publications, so I couldn't capture everything here, but I believe this encapsulates his most impactful works. Considering the trend, it seems a lot more is going to come from him in the coming years!

###################################################### Exercise #############################################


Health cheat codes I know at 33, that I wish I knew at 22:

1) Do cardio for overall health & longevity, do exercise to build muscle & strength, do diet to burn fat , do yoga/stretching for mobility.

2) 7-8 hours of sleep is non-negotiable. The percentage of people who can have perfect physiology with less than 7 hour of sleep is almost zero.

3)5-10 minute of sunlight exposure within the first couple of hours of waking up is crucial. It boosts energy, brain power and helps to fall asleep at night in the right time

4) If you had less than 7 hour of sleep or if you are feeling low in energy- take a short nap.

5) Workout atleast 3 times per week. Get brutally strong in basic compound movements like Overhead Press, pullups, Dips, rows, Squats, deadlift etc . Try to progress in these exercises in each week .

6) Perfect the form of these exercises. Have proper mind-muscle connection when working out. Ask for help from your trainer in the gym, or watch good tutorials in youtube. Perfecting the form will keep you injury free , while making you the best gains.

7) Pick any form of cardio that you enjoy. Do it as often as you can.

8 ) For the vast majority of people the best way to do cardio is to walk outside. Walk at least 8k steps per day.

9 ) Prioritize having plenty of vegetables and protein in each meal. If you want to build muscle and strength- try to hit at least 1.8 gram of protein per kilo of body weight everyday.

10) Carbohydrates are not bad. In fact, they are key to optimal performance in exercise . What is really bad, is processed foods. Minimize processed foods, as much as you can.

11) Intermittent fasting is a great tool to stay in calorie deficit very easily and loose fat. But, it is not at all necessary. Many people function well, when having a good breakfast .

11) In a chaotic world, stillness of mind is key. The time tested way to foster a calm mind, is by praying/ meditating or spending time in nature .

12) Have coffee at least 1-2 hour after waking up . Have water, before having coffee.

13) Have a pullup bar in your home. You can build really impressive fitness just by doing some pullups, some pushups, some squats/lunges - in your home .

14) Put sunscreen on everyday. Moisturize well in winters .

15) True wealth is a house full of love. Give time to your family. 

16) Gratitude is like vitamin D , for soul. Even a tiny amount can nourish your soul . When you remember old friends, drop them a message , saying you missed them. Tell your partner that you love him/her.

17) Drink a lot of water. 2 liter is bare minimum, 3 liters plus, if you are active

18) Do some form of stretching/yoga everyday- even if it is for 1-2 minutes . This will keep you mobile

19) If all these sound too much at least do the following: prioritize vegetables and proteins in each meal , get 7 hour+ sleep, lift 3x a week, walk 8k+ steps & drink plenty of water.
